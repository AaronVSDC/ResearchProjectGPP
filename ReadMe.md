# GameplayProgramming Research Project
for my research project of the GPP course at DAE I decided to make a demonstration about the Theta* algorithm. In this demo we will look at an example of both the A* algorithm and how the Theta* algorithm differs from A*. 


## A*

The A* algorithm is a very popular algorithm that finds the shortest path in a given grid (like dijkstra) but uses heuristic as an optimization.
